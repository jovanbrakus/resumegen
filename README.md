Resume Generator
==============
Resume Generator is an web app that generates PDF resumes that follows Gayle L. MacDowell's hints from www.careercup.com/resume.

You can see application running at http://resume.brakus.rs
Also, app is ready to be deployed to Heroku. All you need to get it up and running is free Heroku account.

For PDF file generation reportlab's open source PDF generating python library is used.

Libs used:
* Django
* Reportlab (PDF generating lib)

While most likely devs can use this as an example of ReportLab lib usage, if you want to hear more from her about Gayle's HR experience from Google, or simply are preparing youself for interview about IT job, I'd recommend listening this interview with her: http://www.extroverteddeveloper.com/blog/2012/8/30/extroverted-developer-18-gayle-laakmann-mcdowell.html
